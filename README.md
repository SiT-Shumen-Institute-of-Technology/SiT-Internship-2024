# SiT-Internship-2024
SiT Access Control System is a web-based solution developed by high school students during their internship at Shumen Institute of Technology (SiT). The project combines modern web technologies with hardware integration to create a secure and efficient platform for managing and monitoring access to restricted areas and to track attendance in the office. Technologies Used: ASP.NET Core for the backend and web interface. Arduino Uno as the controller for processing data from an RFID-RC522 card reader. Role-based access control and real-time access logging. Key Features: RFID Integration: Arduino collects data from RFID cards and sends it to the web server for validation and processing. Secure Role Management: Grant or restrict access based on predefined roles. Access Logging: Comprehensive logs for attendance and access tracking. Modular and scalable design for future enhancements.
